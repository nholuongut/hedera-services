/**
 * A time-limited cache of transaction records and receipts.
 *
 * <p>Each {@link com.hedera.hapi.node.base.Transaction} has a unique {@link TransactionID}. Each {@link TransactionID}
 * is valid for only a certain period of time. If submitted before the {@link TransactionID#transactionValidStart()}
 * then the transaction is invalid. If submitted after the network configured expiration time from that start time,
 * then the transaction is invalid. Between those two times, the network needs to deduplicate transactions.
 *
 * <p>It may be that the same transaction is submitted by the user multiple times to the same node. The node uses this
 * cache as a mechanism to detect those duplicate transactions and reject the duplicates.
 *
 * <p>It may be that transactions with the same {@link TransactionID} may be submitted by the user to multiple nodes.
 * If this happens, we need to only process one of those transactions, but charge the node + network fees to the user
 * for each transaction they submitted.
 *
 * <p>It may be that a dishonest node receives a transaction from the user and sends multiple copies of it. This
 * needs to be detected and the node charged for the duplicate transactions.
