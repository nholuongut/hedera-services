/**
 * When an account's balance is changed by an EVM call, it is necessary to ensure that any Hedera system contract
 * running within the same frame can immediately see the change. This means that waiting for commit() to be called on a
 * WorldUpdater is not an option; instead, the "parallel" Hedera world state must be updated immediately.
 *
 * <p>This class defines the callback mechanism that a mutated account uses to report its balance changes to the Hedera
 * world state when executing an EVM transaction on a consensus node. Accounts that are "mutated" during an
 * eth_estimateGas call running on a mirror node do not actually change, so a null implementation of the callback can be
 * provided in such cases.
