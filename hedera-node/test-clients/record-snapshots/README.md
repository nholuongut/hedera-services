## Record snapshots

This directory stores JSON documents with Base64-encoded record stream items generated by executing a
`HapiSpec`. The files are named with the convention `<SuiteName>-<specName>.json`. 

Along with the Base64-encoded (`TransactionBody`, `TransactionRecord`) pairs that make up the record
stream item, each JSON snapshot has the number of entities in state before the `HapiSpecOperation`'s of 
the spec were executed as a top-level key `placeholderNum`. (This lets us fuzzy-match the ids of entities 
created during one execution of the `HapiSpec` with the entities created during another execution of the 
`HapiSpec`.) 

The `SnapshotModeOp` utility operation is used to create these snapshots. Please see that class for more
usage information.

### Important caveats
1. There is generally no point in taking a snapshot of a `HapiSpec` that has non-deterministic ordering of operations, unless maybe you just want to inspect the generated records.
2. The `SnapshotModeOp` does do any "fingerprinting" of `HapiSpec` operations at the time it produces a snapshot. If someone changes the operations without re-taking the snapshot, the snapshot will be out of date and useless!
